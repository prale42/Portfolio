					<h3>About</h3>
					<p>
						As you already know, my name is Matej. I am an aspiring web
						developer who is always looking to learn new skills and take on new
						challenges. I've been playing around with web development for about
						2 months now and it's been a helluva ride.
					</p>

				<div class="text-box text-box2">
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>
						Currently I'm dabbling around in fronted development. I think it's
						the easiest way to start and the best way to build upon that
						knowledge later. I plan on becoming a fullstack developer as soon as
						I think I'm ready.
					</p>

				<div class="text-box text-box3">
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>
						I finished a mathematics and natural science high school with good
						grades and enrolled in an electronics/computer science college where
						I am now at my third year. Lately I have drifted away from
						electronics (which I still sometimes do as a hobby) into the murky
						waters web development. 
				</div>
				<div class="text-box text-box4">
					<h3>Skills</h3>
					<p>
						I'm getting to know my way around HTML, CSS and JS very
						well. That doesn't mean I haven't tried and enjoyed
						backend/fullstack projects, it's just that I want to
						learn the basic stuff first. I am familiar with couple
						of other programming languages like Java, Python and C.
						I also have excellent skills in written and spoken
						english.
