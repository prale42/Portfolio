						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>
							As you already know, my name is Matej. I am an aspiring web
							developer who is always looking to learn new skills and take on
							new challenges. I've been playing around with web development for
							a few months now and it's been a helluva ride.

						<h3>Interests</h3>
						<p>
							Currently I'm dabbling around in fronted development. I think it's
							the easiest way to start and the best way to build upon that
							knowledge later. I plan on becoming a fullstack developer as soon
							as I think I'm ready.

						<h3>Education</h3>
						<p>
							I finished a mathematics and natural science high school with good
							grades and enrolled in an electronics/computer science college
							where I am now at my third year. Lately I have drifted away from
							electronics (which I still sometimes do as a hobby) into the murky
							waters web development.

						<h3>Skills</h3>
						<p>
							I'm getting to know my way around HTML, CSS and JS very well. That
							doesn't mean I haven't tried and enjoyed backend/fullstack
							projects and/or frameworks, it's just that I want to learn the
							basic stuff first. I am familiar with couple of other programming
							languages like Java, Python and C. I also have excellent skills in
							written and spoken english.
